# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).

# Examples:

#   cities = City.create([{ :name => 'Chicago' }, { :name => 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(:name => 'Daley', :city => cities.first)

Chunks of stone and mortar from the walls are missing or scorched from misguided weapon blows and dodged spells. A rolling fog of blue mist envelopes the loose dirt floor.' })
