* TODO lost link characters from multiple accounts
** log jim.Xaeric in
** ll
** log jim.Fred in
** Xaeric and Fred both logged in from same account

* TODO need to tell if char is connected without relying on mob.char; mob.char should always be active
** e.g. with cmd look, send [LOST LINK] if mob.char and mob.char.disconnected, doesn't work if mob.char = nil

* TODO case-insensitive account name recognition
** repro
*** 1. make account Foo
*** 2. close connection
*** 3. log in with account foo
*** That account name is in use. -> it knows to match foo with Foo, but doesn't load correctly
** spec test for this
